# SCP-018 | Original SCP

Someone did it.<br>
A moron, a jerk, a human being.<br>
All it took was a few inches of fall for the fucking ball to go off.<br>
Often when we think of every anomaly we hold, we quickly think of all the unimaginable horrors that by their mere perception have indelibly marked our organization.<br><br>

It's strange, such a litle thing can do.<br>
The most terrifying things are the ones we don't understand,<br>
And no one understands how a 6 centimeter plastic bullet inspires such terror.<br>

### üõ†Ô∏è Functionality

SCP-018 is a ball that can bounce with over two hundred percent (200%) efficiency.<br>
So avoid dropping it, or consequences.<br>
You can also pick it up and throw it or put it on the ground, the pick up is only possible when the ball is completely still.<br><br>

There are only two ways to stop it, by falling into the water, it will lose its bounce efficiency, or via another SCP...<br>

### üß© GameModes

Is compatible on all gamemodes normally, but I recommend its use on ```darkrp``` if possible.
